I am a fourth year in Michigan Tech's CS department and I will be graduating Fall 2017. 
After my second year at Tech, I interned at Schneider in Green Bay some testing and software development projects.
After my third year at Tech, I interned at a company called Williams Distributing near my home town Kalamazoo.
Hopefully, if ahead of schedule in class, we could learn more about encryption as I find it very interesting.
